##Assignment 1
I used normal, poisson, binomial,chi-square and gumbel distribution.

##Assignment 2
1. At first I could not load citibike file because: 

1) environmental variable "PUIDATA" refers to "PUIdata" in my directory. I thought "PUIdata" was a directory but actually it is a file

2) run the code "load.jasn" to decode zip file into csv.
2. I had trouble group my variables into groups and don't have enough time to learn and cover it. This part is missing for now.
