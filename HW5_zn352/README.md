## Assignment 3

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

	Null Hypothesis: The kilo of fat participants lose over diets is less or equal to kilo of fat participants
	(in control group) lose over exercise during a certain period of time. 
	H0 = P(diet) - P(excer) <= 0
	H1 = P(diet) - P(excer) > 0
	
Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

	Null Hypothesis: The sample of this poll results is not representitive to the American. 
	Do statistical test and set the alpha = 0.5. 
	H0 = P0 - P1 <= 0
	H1 = P0 - P1 > 0

Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

	Null Hypothesis: The cessation rates for smokers who use a nicotine patch is less or eqaul to cessation rates
	of smokers who use a placebo patch.
	Do statistical test and set the alpha = 0.5. 
	H0 = P(nico) - P(plab) <= 0
	H1 = P(nico) - P(plab) > 0
	
Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

	Null Hypothesis: The IQ of children at 1-4 years of age whose mother smoke during pregnancy is equal to 
	or greater than children at 1-4 years of age whose mother never smoke during their pregnancy. 
	Do statistical test and set the alpha = 0.5. 
	H0 = P(nonsmoking) - P(smoking) <=0
	H1 = P(nonsmoking) - P(smoking) > 0
