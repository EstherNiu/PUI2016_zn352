### a. Verify formatting of Null and Alternative Hypotheses
The Null Hypothesis here is actually the Alternative Hypothesis. Since the idea is that younger people take longer rides, the Null Hypothesis should say, "The average trip duration time of people born before 1970 is _same or greater_ than the average trip duration time of people born after 1970."

The Alternative Hypothesis should say, "The average trip duration time of people born before 1970 is _shorter_ than the average trip duration time of people born after 1970."

### b. Verify that the data supports the project 
Yes, the data appears to appropriately support the project. The 'tripduration' and 'birth year' variables are necessary for analysis. 

### c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. 
For this analysis, I recommend using a _t_-test as it allows you to measure the differences between two groups (independent variables) on one dependent variable. Refer to [CSU cheat-sheet](http://www.csun.edu/~amarenco/Fcs%20682/When%20to%20use%20what%20test.pdf) for more info.
